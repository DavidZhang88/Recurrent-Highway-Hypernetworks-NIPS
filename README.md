8/11/17: Initial commit. Code cleaned from original repo. I still have some polishing to do on the utils/nlp libraries and train/test system. I have not yet tested consistency with the original repo; this will begin tomorrow, but runs take 2-3 days. Feel free to take a look at the core modules until then, but I don't advise cloning yet.

4/11/17: Stub repo for associated NIPS Paper. Code is currently being cleaned and tested for upload--give it 4 days to a week
