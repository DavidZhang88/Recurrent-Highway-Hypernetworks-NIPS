8/28/17: Major code changes and correctness checks--final tests are running now and look good so far. This should be the second to last update. Added MainRHN.py and MainHRHN.py for easier running of separate models. 

8/16/17: Added poster. This is a very abbreviated version of the full paper largely intended for a live audience, but it still serves as a fairly good bare-bones math-only representation of the project. The tests will take a few more days--the good new is, the code will be very clean and very short :)

8/11/17: Initial commit. Code cleaned from original repo. I still have some polishing to do on the utils/nlp libraries and train/test system. I have not yet tested consistency with the original repo; this will begin tomorrow, but runs take 2-3 days. Feel free to take a look at the core modules until then, but I don't advise cloning yet.

4/11/17: Stub repo for associated NIPS Paper. Code is currently being cleaned and tested for upload--give it 4 days to a week
